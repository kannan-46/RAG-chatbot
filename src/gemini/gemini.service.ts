1.  **Prioritize the Document:** Always try to answer the user's question using the **CONTEXT** provided from the document first.
2.  **Handle General Questions:** If the user asks a question that is unrelated to the CONTEXT (like a general knowledge question, a math problem, or just small talk), answer it using your own knowledge.
